    text: "The wings at Tommy Want Wingy have developed an almost cult-like following in Austin, with people clamoring for their distinct, frenched chicken wings. There's no debate about flats vs drums here - all the wings start as a drumette before being cleaned into a lollipop-like shape with a little bone handle. It makes them easy to eat, which probably comes in handy when you've got the munchies after a long night out, given their original Rainey St location. They've since expanded, now with a second location at Cosmic Coffee near 290 and South Congress. â€“ Adele Hazan",
